   INSTRUCTIONS:

   Place this file in a folder named programming/3/.

   This file contains the following completed method. Use it as a model
   to help you with the other methods:

   - buildBoard

   This file also contains stubs (empty methods) for the following
   methods (split into 3 levels):

   Basic level (complete all):
   - printBoard *
   - copyBoard *

   Intermediate level (complete Basic methods plus this method):
   - explodeSquare *

   Advanced level (complete Basic + Intermediate + these two methods):
   - explodeAllChar *
   - downString

   The routines with the * will be particularly helpful for the
   Conway's Game of Life project that you'll work on after this one.

     Change the 2D array board so that all the elements in the

     Parameters:
     board - a 2D array of char
     row,col - ints specifying a location in board

     Returns:
     nothing

     A location in a 2D array can be though of as having 6
     neighbors.  In the below 2D array, the neighbors of the element
     marked Q are the numbered elements.

     oooooo
     o123oo
     o4Q5oo
     o678oo
     oooooo

     This method should change all the neighbor cells (elements) to an X
     but not change the element at row,col

     Ex:
     Given the 2D array
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ
     QQQQQ

     explodeSquare(board,1,1) will change the array to
     XXXQQ
     XQXQQ
     XXXQQ
     QQQQQ

     Note: Make sure to correctly handle the cases when you try
     to explode an element on the edges.

     row,col - ints specifying a location in board
     word - a String that you want to insert into the board.

     This will insert the parameter word into board in the downward
     direction. See examples below

     Example:

     Given this array

     xxxxxx
     xxxxxx

     xHxxxx
     xExxxx
     xLxxxx
     xLxxxx
     xOxxxx
     xxxxxx

     Given the above array, downString(board,4,3,"World") will

     xxxxxx
     xHxxxx
     xExxxx
     xLxxxx

     xOxOxx
